Findings Report:

During the course of our investigation into Lucky Duck Casino, we were able to identify two things.
On the days of March 10th, 12th and 15th, there were recorded losses.
On these days of losses, there was one particular Player who was present in the record 13 times.

With further evaluation into the exact times and of these dates of the recorded losses, we were able to compare 
correlating Dealer schedules to reveal the Dealer who most likely colluded with this repeated Player to scam Lucky Duck Casino.

With this proof, we have identified Mylie Schmidt as the Player of intrest,
and Billy Jones as the Dealer of intrest.
